# Overdose
 Allows overdosing inside SCP:SL in an Exiled plugin.
 
 To install the plugin, move the Overdose.dll file to your Exiled plugins folder then restart
 the server; after that a configuration file should be generated in the Exiled config files. 
 If you'd like to change anything with the plugin, just look inside there to see if you can.
 If there is any bugs or issues, please report them inside the issues page of this github page
 so I can address them. Other than that, I think the rest of the plugin is self explanitory, so
 enjoy!
